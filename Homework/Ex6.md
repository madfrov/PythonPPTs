# 1. 1. Given a string "hello_world_school", how do you get a list ["hello", "world" , "shool"]?

# 1.2 Given a string str, output the mth character that occurs only n times, e.g., in the string gbgkkdehh, find the 2nd character that occurs only 1 time, output the result: d

# 1.3 Given a number a, determine whether a number is odd or even.

# 1.4 Take the string s = "ajldjlajfdljfddd", de-duplicate it, and sort it from smallest to largest, and output "adfjl".

# 1.5 If you have a list a = [1,3,5,7,11], how do you invert it to [11,7,5,3,1] and get the odd number [1,5,11]?

# 1.5 Read n rows of numbers from the console window each row has different size of number calculate the average of all numbers using two different methods.
1. nested loop by indexing
2. nested loop by element

# 1.6 Given two positive integers m and n, m lines of n elements, giving an m×n× matrix A, followed by two non-negative integers i and j less than n, swap columns i and j of A and print the result.

## Write a function `swap_columns(a, i, j)` and call it to exchange the columns.
