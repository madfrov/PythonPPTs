# Exercise 5

# List

#### Q0：Question: Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320

#### Q1: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.



#### Q2: Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. 

#### Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: without,hello,bag,world 

#### Then, the output should be: bag,hello,without,world



#### Q3: Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

#### Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: Hello world Practice makes perfect 

#### Then, the output should be: HELLO WORLD PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT



#### Q4: Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given 

#### formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H] 

#### Following are the fixed values of C and H: C is 50. H is 30. 

#### D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence. 

#### Example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to 

#### the program: 100,150,180 

#### The output of the program should be: 18,22,24 (import math)



#### Q5: Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically. 

#### Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 

#### hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again

#### Then, the output should be: again and hello makes perfect practice world



#### Q6: Question: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence. 

#### Example: 0100,0011,1010,1001 Then the output should be: 1010 



# Tuple

#### Question7: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98 Then, the output should be: 

#### ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']

#### ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')





# 2D-Lists

#### Q8: Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Example Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5 Then, the output of the program should be: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]



#### Q9: Create a function that takes a grid of # and -, where each hash (#) represents a mine and each dash (-) represents a mine-free spot.Return a grid, where each dash is replaced by a digit, indicating the number of mines immediately adjacent to the spot i.e. (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).



# Dictionary

#### Q10: With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
