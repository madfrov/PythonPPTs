# Exercise 5

# List

#### Q1: Given a list, move all zeros to the end of the elements while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. For example, input list: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12] the return data should be: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]Complete the function below for the above intention.

#### def moveZeros(lst):



#### Q2: Complete the function below. Here are the input parameters: tup is a tuple of all strings. word and target are strings. If an element of the tub is same as word, replace it with target. Return the updated tuple. 

#### def replaceWord (tup, word, target) : 





#### Q3: Step1: Given two integers representing the rows and columns (m√ón), input a 2d list of integers from your keyboard. Input can be read row by row or element by element. Step2: Then find the index positions of the maximum element and the minimum element, Step3: swap the positions for the maximum and the minimum. Step4: Print the result of the 2D list. You can assume every integer in the list is different. Requirement: swapping must be done within the original 2D list, which means the input 2D list will be changed after swapping



#### Q4: Write a function that includes all the students in our class as well as your name, the names are arranged in a list according to your class number, find out where your name is in the list

#### def findMyself(class,name):



#### Q5: Given an array of integers nums, find one of the peak elements and return its index. A peak element is an element whose value is strictly greater than the values of its left and right neighbors. There may be more than one peak in the array; simply return the index of any one peak.

for example I have a list [0,3,5,2,1] the peak number should be 5
