## 4.In a competition, there are five judges who score the participants. To calculate a participant's score, the highest and lowest scores are removed and then averaged, and that value is the final score

## 5.A matrix = [ [1, 3, 5], [2, 6, 8], [7, 9, 4]] is entered from the keyboard and it is required to transpose the matrix by code. The transposed matrix is [ [1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 9], [5, 8, 4]]
