## 1.Input a list of data, separated by commas, and find the average, maximum, and minimum values of this list of data, and sort them in order from smallest to largest

## 2.Input a list of non-empty positive integers, sorted by the number of times that number is repeated in the list, from highest to lowest.（Hint: use library counter: from collections import Counter）

## 3.Keyboard input a list of non-empty positive integers, delete the duplicate data in the list

## 4.In a competition, there are five judges who score the participants. To calculate a participant's score, the highest and lowest scores are removed and then averaged, and that value is the final score

## 5.A matrix = [ [1, 3, 5], [2, 6, 8], [7, 9, 4]] is entered from the keyboard and it is required to transpose the matrix by code. The transposed matrix is [ [1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 9], [5, 8, 4]]
